00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,000
Our aim for this project was to design a

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,900
Wireless Cardiac Auscultation 
and At-Home Monitoring System.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,300
This includes a wearable device that 
continuously records the user’s heart sounds 

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,600
and an accompanying application, where 
the user would be able to interact with 

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,000
the received recordings.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,300
The wireless device consists of a PETG 3D-printed 
shell which encloses the battery along with 

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,000
the custom designed printed circuit board 
where the overall size of the device was 

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,500
kept to a minimum with a 
size of 5 x 7 x 2.6 centimetres.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,300
The PCB houses all of the electronic
components including a MEMS microphone and 

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,600
an ESP32 microcontroller with an antenna.

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,500
Designed for direct skin contact, the base of 
the enclosure is made from a TPU plastic due to 

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,500
its hypoallergenic properties with a 
cut out for the microphone.

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,000
The enclosure is held in a brace that ensures 
the microphone maintains a constant contact 

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,300
with the skin to get the best audio quality 
with reduced motion artifacts. 

15
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,000
The brace is designed to be worn with the 
device for long periods of time while 

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,200
carrying out daily activities, 
therefore must ensure the wearer’s 

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,200
comfort and device security.
By using elastic bands and a buckle, 

18
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,500
the brace can accommodate a range of body 
types and still maintain a secure tight fit. 


19
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,600
The device is placed on the user’s mitral 
point from which it records the heart sounds.


20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,600
These are sampled at a rate of 1 kHz for 
10 seconds at a time using the MEMS microphone 

21
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,300
with a calibrated ADC.

22
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:25,200
The ESP32 microcontroller powering the device 
is responsible for carrying out the recording 

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,600
and storage of the heart sounds on the device 
then transferring them over to the application 

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,000
using Bluetooth Low Energy.

25
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,600
The application handles receiving communication 
from the MCU, data storage, data processing, 

26
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,200
and user interaction.

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,300
The app features 3 sections each designed 
to be as user friendly as possible with good 

28
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,200
object oriented programming practices 
followed throughout, including the use of 

29
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,400
design patterns like observer and callback.

30
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,400
From the recordings screen the user can track 
and manage all their recordings, including 

31
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,000
filtering, sorting, adding/viewing tags, and more.


32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,300
From the device settings screen the user 
can manage the connection with the physical 


33
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:04,000
device including connecting and disconnecting 
and setting the recording mode.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,100
In addition, a machine learning model runs in 
a background thread of the application and 

35
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,100
analyses the recorded heart sounds 
to categorise them as either 

36
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,100
normal, abnormal or unknown.

37
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,100
The machine learning model is trained on 
data classified by expert cardiologists. 

38
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:23,000
It processes each received audio file and 
transforms it into a mel-frequency spectrogram, 

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,100
which allows for the use of a 
Convolutional Neural Network. 

40
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,400
These models are suited for identifying spatial
patterns, such as heart sound abnormalities.

41
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,000
The model achieves an accuracy of 90% in 
healthy and unhealthy classification when 

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,500
applied to unseen test sets, and around 75% 
during real-world deployments. 

43
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,300
The project successfully met the aim of creating a 

44
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,500
Wireless Cardiac Auscultation
and At-Home Monitoring System 

45
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,000
and managed to expand on its goal by 
incorporating a machine learning model 

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,500
and a brace into the project.
